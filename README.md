## About the Project

This project is a Python-based YouTube video downloader that allows users to download videos in the highest resolution available. The application uses the `pytube` library for downloading videos and `tkinter` for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) to select the download directory.

## Features

- **High-Resolution Downloads**: Downloads the video in the highest resolution available in MP4 format.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Uses `tkinter` to provide a simple GUI for selecting the download directory.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors during the download process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the project.
- **pytube**: For accessing and downloading YouTube videos.
- **tkinter**: For creating the GUI to select the download directory.

## How It Works

1. **Enter YouTube URL**: The user is prompted to enter the URL of the YouTube video they wish to download.
2. **Select Download Directory**: A file dialog opens, allowing the user to select the directory where the video will be saved.
3. **Download Video**: The video is downloaded in the highest resolution available to the selected directory.
